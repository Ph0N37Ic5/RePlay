#### Media playback
Playing back audio to a number of different outputs, allowing for visual routing and envelopes. Video and picture media should be visually routed to outputs and surfaces allowing for mapping and envelopes.

#### Cue lists
Arranging playbacks in lists allowing them to be triggered and stopped by midi triggers, key presses, or timecodes.

#### Network playback
Allowing networked computers, such as raspberry pi'es, to distribute and play back media, controlled by the central controller.
Networked computers could also be allowed to act as playback triggers.
